# Point-of-Sale-System
A point of sale system developed using a database to efficiently display content that may be used across many devices. Currently requires a database to function and may not be updated.

Please check out "PB311-Final-Report.pdf" for a full description of the project. My contribution was the majority of the programming for the software, where UX, UI, database design, and content was developed by the rest of the group.
